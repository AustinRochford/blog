I am a data scientist and recovering mathematician from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I am passionate about math education, statistics, machine learning, software development, functional programming, pit bulls, and reptiles.

I currently work at [Monetate](http://www.monetate.com) as a Principal Data Scientist in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.
