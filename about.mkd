I am Austin Rochford, a PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.uiuc.edu) at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](http://www.uiuc.edu).  My academic research is in [operator algebras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_algebra), specifically the relationship between geometric group theory and analytic approximation properties.

As I near the completion of my degree, I am transitioning into an industry career in data science.

I am passionate about math education, statistics, machine learning, software development, functional programming, and [pit](/images/snowdogs.png) [bulls](http://rescueapittie.org/).
