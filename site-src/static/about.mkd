I am a data scientist and recovering mathematician from Philadelphia. I am passionate about math education, (Bayesian) statistics, machine learning, software development, functional programming, pit bulls, and reptiles.  I am a member of the [PyMC3](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/) development team.

I am currently Principal Data Scientist at [Monetate](http://www.monetate.com) in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.
