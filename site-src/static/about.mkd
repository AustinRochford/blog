I am a data scientist and recovering mathematician from Philadelphia. I am passionate about math education, (Bayesian) statistics, machine learning, software development, functional programming, pit bulls, and reptiles.  I am a member of the [PyMC3](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/) development team.

I am currently Chief Data Scientist of [Kibo Commerce](https://kibocommerce.com/), and formerly held several data science leadership roles at [Monetate](https://monetate.com/) before Monetate was acquired by Kibo in October 2019.
